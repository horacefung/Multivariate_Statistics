###Some data processing
#1) We need to create binaries for default
#2) Fill na's for delinquencies 
#3) Fix the employment length

colnames(loans) <- c('default', 'loan_amnt', 'int_rate', 'employment', 'homeowner', 'income', 'dti', 'delinq_2yrs', 'open_acc', 'pub_derog', 'pub_bankrupt')
colnames(loans)
```
```{r}
#Create binaries
loans[loans$default == 'Default' | loans$default == 'Charged Off',][1] <- 1
loans[loans$default == 'Fully Paid',][1] <- 0
```
```{r}
#Fix employment length
loans <- loans[loans$employment != 'n/a',]
loans$employment <- gsub("\\D", "", loans$employment)
loans$employment <- as.numeric(loans$employment)
```
```{r}
#Define 3 groups
hist(loans$employment, breaks=seq(0,10,l=10))
```
```{r}
#The best we can do is redefine the groups for employemnt
#Below 1 years, above 10 years and everyone else
loans[loans$employment < 10,][4] <- 'below_10'
loans[loans$employment == 10,][4] <- "10_or_above"
```
```{r}
#Turn bankruptcies and derogratories and deliquncies into binary
loans[loans$delinq_2yrs != 0,][8] <- 1
loans[loans$pub_derog != 0,][10] <- 1
loans[loans$pub_bankrupt != 0,][11] <- 1
```
```{r}
#Lets also drop OWN in homeowners, keep it 1/0 situation

```
```{r}
#Randomnize 
loans <- sample(loans)
```
```{r}

#Can we sample something similar to that 
defaults <- loans[loans$default == 1,]
paid <- loans[loans$default == 0,]
```
```{r}
##Opt to do this retroactively. Sample 500 1's and 500 0's, then adjust B0.
train <- rbind(head(defaults,500), head(paid,500))
test <- rbind(tail(defaults,800), tail(paid,200))
